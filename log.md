### Day 10: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Data Analytics with Python course: Panda series videos and exercises

**Thoughts:** Relieved that this actually makes sense so far and builds on things I've already learned. Also, will always be excited to learn about something called pandas, even if it's not the cute animal :panda_face:

### Day 13: January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Data Analytics with Python course: reading in data. Practiced reading in html table and data from LA City open data API to practice. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 14: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Data Analytics with Python course: Python intro. Looked a little more at the LA City data about fire station calls and responses.

**Thoughts:** Interesting to explore real data. Part of what I need to learn is how to make sure I understand what data is saying/what I expect to see (for example, tried making plots today, could tell something was wrong, but not entirely sure what). Also was relieved that I actually followed/already knew most of what was covered in the Intro to Python section - I kind of know some things!

### Day 15: January 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic HTML and HTML5 course (part of Responsive Web Design curriculum).

**Thoughts:** Was feeling a little stuck and demotivated so decided to switch things up. I've done some web development tutorials before so most of this was familiar but sometimes it's helpful to go back to the basics and get a firm foundation.

### Day 16: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Basic CSS course (part of Responsive Web Design curriculum).

**Thoughts:** Continuing with the basics of web design.

### Day 17: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Applied Visual Design course (part of Responsive Web Design curriculum).

**Thoughts:** Continuing with the basics of web design and fun things you can do with CSS. I didn't know how much it could be used for graphics/animation!

### Day 18: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did some practice with Pandas and looping through arrays for a work task (comparing membership two LDAP groups).

**Thoughts:** Fun to practice some of what I've learned for an actual use! Still some room for improvement - I could clean the data better and also output it in a more useful format. It would be good to have some reusable code for this type of task because it's something that comes up fairly frequently and seems simple but takes some thought depending on exactly what you want.

### Day 19: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Applied Accessibility class

**Thoughts:** This covered a lot of things that I vaguely knew but didn't concretely know how to address or exactly what mattered.
